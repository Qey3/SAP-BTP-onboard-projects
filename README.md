# This is series of projects that allow you to get familiar with SAP environment and tools step-by-step.
Each project assumes that you have completed the previous one, studied the information and know how to use 
the technologies you have studied from previous one.

# Project list:
- `1.Manifest_project` – Demonstrates how to build a simple application using manifest.yaml 
with XSUAA and App Router services and deploy it to SAP BTP.
- `2.Manifest_log_project` – Shows how to configure and manage logging for your application.
- `3.Destination_apps` – Provides an example of using SAP Cloud SDK to establish connectivity with external services.

# If you get stuck at any point, don't hesitate to check the project's README file or folder structure. 
I've included additional problem-solving descriptions in each project based on challenges I encountered along the way.
