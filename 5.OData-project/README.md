# This application can extract some data from special OData resource.

# First install `com.sap.cloud.sdk` and read documentation how to generate OData client:
 - [https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/vdm-generator]

# If you encounter issues with the V2 OData service from:
   ðŸ”— https://services.odata.org/northwind/northwind.svc/
# You should use the V4 OData service instead:
ðŸ”— https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/$metadata

# Generate classes through the plugin -> [Plugins -> odata-v4-generator] 

# If you have troubles with generated package name, set up your own configuration in [pom.xml] 
# and [serviceNameMappings.properties] files

# Deploy our app
