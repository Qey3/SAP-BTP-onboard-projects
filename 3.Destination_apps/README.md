## Here are the applications than can communicate using a configured Destination.
* First, create destination in your `SAP BTP Cockpit` `Subaccount -> Connectiviy -> Destinations`.
* Set up `url` to second app, choose `BasicAuthentication` and type `login` and `password` from second app.
* You can use destination in your app with `com.sap.cloud.sdk` library, which allows you to retrieve a registered SAP Destination by name and use it for making requests.

### It may be helpful to set up `correlation id` propagation between microservices:
1. [How to make 2 microservices log one error with the same correlation ID](https://leverxeu.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQDsQAE)
2. One approach that worked for me was using Logback for logging and configuring the log output format to JSON in the Logback configuration.

### Local testing
 - You can [running an application locally](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/running-locally)
