## This project has been made step-by-stem from this tutorial:
- [Create an Application with SAP Java Buildpack](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-cf-buildpacks-java-create.html)

### If you encounter issues with role creation, donâ€™t worry! You can resolve this by modifying your xs-security.json file:
Add your own `role-collections`, ensuring they include `role-template-references` that reference your role.
Once updated, the role collection with linked roles will be automatically created and assigned to your `Subaccount`.
Additionally, you should go to your role collection `Security -> Role Collections -> <your role collection name> -> edit` ,
and add your e-mail in 'User' list.

### Commands that have been used in this project:
